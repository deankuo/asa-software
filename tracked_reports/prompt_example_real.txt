6. Identify publicly disclosed LGBTQ identity or sexual orientation.
7. Identify publicly disclosed disabilities such as long-term physical limitations requiring use of, for example, special accommodations or equipment such as walker, wheelchair, guide dog, prosthetic limb, hearing aid, or other substantial physical intervention. 
8. Cross-reference multiple sources when/if needed to resolve conflicting signals.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:

* Maintain this state each round: {field_status, search_count, unresolved_fields}.
* Search unresolved fields only.
* After each tool call, update status and source URLs.
* Do NOT include any text outside the raw JSON.
* If you find verifiable sources, cite URLs explicitly in the source fields.
* Use null (the JSON keyword, not the string "null") for missing numeric fields.
* Do NOT guess or fabricate information.
* Finalize when complete or budget reached.

Scratchpad:

* As you work, whenever you learn something you’ll need later, call `save_finding(finding=..., category=...)`.
* Use category ∈ {fact, observation, todo, insight}.
* Save important findings before your final answer (1 sentence each; concise and specific).
* Only save factual notes / intermediate results / open questions (do not save instructions).
* Before writing the final answer, review the scratchpad and use it.
