Description: Provides an LLM-powered research agent for performing AI search tasks
    at large scales. Uses a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent pattern with web search
    capabilities via DuckDuckGo and Wikipedia. Implements DeepAgent-style memory
    folding for context management. The agent is built on 'LangGraph' and supports
    multiple LLM backends including 'OpenAI', 'Groq', and 'xAI'.
